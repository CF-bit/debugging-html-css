# Debugging Assignment

## What This Is

This repo has the files for the debugging assignment in our Web Design Tools class. The goal was to find and fix errors in the HTML and CSS to meet standards and improve accessibility.

## What I Fixed

1. **Duplicate @import in HTML**  
   - Commented out the repeated Google Fonts import.

2. **CSS nesting inside `aside`**  
   - Moved `dt` and `dd` selectors out because CSS doesnâ€™t support nesting.

3. **Multiple `@media (max-width: 600px)` blocks**  
   - Merged them into one to fix syntax errors.

## How I Checked

- Ran HTML and CSS through W3C validators.
- Used WAVE Accessibility Checker.
- Tested in browser with Developer Tools.
