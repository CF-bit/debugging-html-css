1. **I fixed broken or missing HTML tags**

I made sure all tags were properly closed and none were missing, so browsers could correctly understand the page structure.

---

2. **I corrected incorrect CSS selectors and typos**

I fixed misspelled CSS class names so styles applied to the right elements.

---

3. **I fixed wrong file paths for images and CSS**

I updated the file paths to make sure the browser could find and load all images and stylesheets.

---

4. **I added the correct DOCTYPE declaration**

I included `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top of the HTML so browsers would render the page in standards mode.

---

5. **I fixed invalid HTML nesting**

I rearranged HTML tags so they were nested properly and followed HTML rules, preventing rendering problems.

---

6. **I corrected CSS syntax errors**

I added missing semicolons, braces, and removed extra commas so the CSS worked without errors.

---

7. **I resolved conflicting CSS properties**

I cleaned up CSS rules that had duplicates or conflicts to make the styling consistent.

---

8. **I replaced deprecated or invalid HTML attributes**

I removed outdated attributes like `align="center"` and used CSS for styling instead.


---

### 9. **I improved accessibility**

I added alt text to images and fixed form labels so the page is easier to use for everyone.
